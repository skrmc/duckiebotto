This repository contains only the "duckiebotto" ROS package,
intended to be used together with the Duckietown ROS template (v4):
https://github.com/duckietown/template-ros/tree/v4

It provides a minimal Duckiebot system that can drive autonomously,
avoid obstacles, and recognize traffic lights, with a web interface.

To build and run this package on your Duckiebot, first clone the 
Duckietown ROS template (v4), and place this repository inside its
packages. Then use the following commands, replacing <duckiebot>
with the hostname of your Duckiebot:

dts devel build -f -H <duckiebot>
dts devel run -H <duckiebot>

You may then navigate to http://<duckiebot>:8888 in your browser.
The webpage icon is from Duckietown (original license applies).
